## Getting started

**[Installation](installation.md)** - This page guides you through all the necessary steps to get up and running with IGP2.

**[First steps](first_steps.md)** - This page guides you through how to run your first driving scenario with IGP2.


## Components

**[Goal recognition](goal_recognition.md)**: The goal recognition module of IGP2 can be run in standalone mode without simulating for motion planning. This page tells you how to do just that.

**[Creating your own scenarios](custom_scenarios.md)**: IGP2 comes with several pre-defined scenarios, but this page will guide you through how you can create your own scenarios.

**[Road layouts](road_layout.md)**: IGP2 relies on the OpenDrive 1.6 standard for road layout definition, however there are some important additional steps you should take when creating your own maps for IGP2. This page will walk you through those steps.

**[Configuration files](configuration_file.md)**: This page gives full documentation of all fields that can appear in configuration files of IGP2.


## Resources

**[Commandline options](commandline_options.md)**: A list of commandline options to be used with `scripts/run.py`.
