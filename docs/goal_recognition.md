# Goal Recognition

## Data
The goal recognition module of IGP2 can be run on existing data sets without the need for CARLA.
Currently, we support [inD](https://www.ind-dataset.com/) and [rounD](https://www.round-dataset.com/) to be used to tune and evaluate the goal recognition algorithm of IGP2.
The contents of the data subdirectories in each of these datasets should be moved into `scenarios/data/ind` and `scenarios/data/round`, respectively.
